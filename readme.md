First thing first I will try to divide in smaller chunks what I have to do: 
          1) - implement model structure, implement the service to return the playlist,
I will add some dummy data first in memory and play a bit with the structures until it matches well
          2) - implement read from a json file and map directly to model structure
          3) - trying to optimize my code, check if there are any problems
          4) - implement as an library

1) While implementing this I already started to question the solution I will go, especially if
I have to return a playlist which is composed by multiple objects, maybe I can do something to directly
compute the right order and maybe add into a MAP, so that by giving the identifier and the language the answer
I will return fast from a MAP, I will try to go a bit into this direction and adjust the models into this direction
